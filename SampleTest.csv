8 Ball Pool,4.5,23672676,,,,,,,
,,,"I really like the game. But you all have to fix whatever is making me have to reconnect to keep the game play from being jerky. And then when it does reconnect, Ill take my shot and then the game will reset like I ran out of time and take away the last shot made. And give the turn to the opponent. It is so frustrating to lose a game over that.",14-04-2022 18:46,Chris Baker,4,1214,,features
,,,It has some flaws. I think the sound effects are good. The visual effects are good. the overall feel of the gameplay is good. I dont like some of the things that get in the way like \your solids\ or \your stripes\ or the pool cue on the left side of the screen that occasionally gets in the way when you take a shot when youre trying to aim. I like that youre able to play by yourself - a timed rapid shot game or a regular game of 8 ball.,12-04-2022 20:13,B Thompson,5,957,,bug
,,,"Lost most of my winnings in a glitch. Very frustrating. I perceive \developement\ as improvement, this game is an example of contrary experience. I like how if there is an issue they put the responsibility on the user to \contact\ them. We are not really here for comunication but for a fun retreat. It was lots of fun! Still kind of addictive if you love shooting pool ;)",02-04-2022 20:48,A Google user,2,289,,positive
,,,"Its actually a fun game, and you can keep a fast pace which I like. Progression is fair even without spending money. When playing the spin game especially, it always lands on low amount. Never once has it landed on a box. So except for spending up the box opening time, and maybe a few other small benefits, I dont see any reason to waste your money n",30-03-2022 20:29,Richard Royal,3,685,,positive
,,,"I spend more time than I should on this game. It was more fun at first. I dont understand why it says its free because its not, the very basics are, and the higher level you get the more the entry fees are, but the free coins is just 50. The cues are so overrated, and the upgrade prices are, too. You might get them unlocked, and be able to use them again, but not like you need to. The win and spin game is rigged, I never get over $250 coins. The gold shot has a glitch.",15-04-2022 20:38,Andrea Greer,3,74,,features
,,,"Why is there even a leave button? I accidentally clicked on Toronto and yknow theres a leave button, lets just click that. It let me leave, then a few seconds later it froze my game and put me in a match. Itll randomly make you miss your shot, scratch, etc. Sometimes it will just go the opposite way the line says it is going. With the lucky, I once made a lucky shot that was pretty easy so I did a golden shot exactly like it and it will overshoot it by a lot. Otherwise game is fun sometimes.",19-04-2022 15:48,f e a d,2,14,,bug
,,,The Spin and Win minigame is 100% rigged. There should be no reason why EVERY time Im only getting 150 coins or 250 coins each spin. I can NEVER get anything higher. The match ups are terrible. You could be paired against someone with an extremely high level cute. Personally I have no problem with it because I still beat most of them. But its just such a hassle.,11-04-2022 05:26,Young E,2,278,,positive
,,,Awesome gameplay. I like that the directional bar shows which direction your ball is going after striking it but its very short causing you to have to do some of the aiming yourself. Alot of different tabs to navigate through on the home screen but they are well separated and after clicking on the few that you use on a regular basis you start to remember where things are at quickly. Well-constructed game.,22-04-2022 12:24,Dave C,5,644,,positive
,,,"So....... I downloaded the app again (I previously had it installed but got bored.) And I played a few games with a friend, and then the game crashed. It wouldnt load and it would just buffer. The only thing I could do was play offline (which btw cost coins). I just redownload it and Im hoping it works. Pls try and fix this glitch. Disappointing.",04-04-2022 06:40,JadePlays224,2,52,,bug
,,,Constant pop-ups! I cant play a lot because I start to make a shot and it does a pop-up while I aim causing missed shots. Beyond the need to watch ads and constant begging for money. Not worth it after giving it an honest try. Maybe if they didnt pop-up things while you try to play causing constant missed shots I could forgive the rest.,14-04-2022 20:49,Quentin Durrstein,1,91,,negative
,,,"Dont bother. Its good until about level 15. Once you hit about 100000 coins, youll start losing easily to \guest\ players at level 2. And if the opponent has the pass, you wont win. The pass grants you high level items and makes winning games against pass holders nearly impossible. The guide lines also make it too easy most of the time. Its designed to get you addicted and spend real money. Like real gambling.",21-04-2022 13:09,Daniel Stuckey,1,3343,,positive
,,,"This game is frustrating. It freezes all the time, connections get lost, and you end up losing a lot of in game money. I just played the golden lucky shot and landed on $75k and it said please wait for opponents response. It literally froze and forced me out. So I had to \shoot\ again, same strength and angle and it barely moved.",09-04-2022 19:58,Tara B,1,49,,negative
,,,I played this game years ago and it was fun. I Uninstalled it and couldnt remember why. After reloading the game I remembered almost immediately. Evertime you go to the main board its constant advert trying to get you to spend $5 on something every 5 minutes. I understand they want to make money but its ridiculous. Its full of glitches and bugs. It requires skill to play which is the only fun part. Past that the app is trash. Probably the most realistic but not worth the headache.,22-04-2022 12:59,Mike Collins,1,398,,bug
,,,"OMG! I love this game! Pool pass purchaser also. I cant give it 5‚≠ê until they fix this issue!!! ü§¨ I have lost over 2 million coins because of glitches the past couple of days. I even recorded a few games. The balls jump around. You sink a ball, then all of a sudden its back on the table and you miss a turn. This is driving me crazy!! Especially when I know it effected me losing 2 million coins in 2 days. ü§¨",24-03-2022 05:44,Kimberly Breckenridge,2,430,,positive
,,,"This game is conspicuously rigged. I have played multiple matches in a row where the balls on the table have suddenly changed positions after they settle from a break or strike on my screen. It usually happens on higher-bet games against higher-level players, which makes me think there is an algorithm to determine the winner and it sometimes glitches to where it has to reposition the balls from where they appear to be on my screen. Its not really fun to play a game with predetermined outcomes.",06-04-2022 20:45,Rick Charles,1,352,,bug
,,,"At one point I enjoyed playing this app then on several occasions the game would delay and restart my shot that I had just made back to the beginning and the time would speed up. Other times, the connection would be so slow and my turn would run out and the other player would win because I didnt take the winning shot. Some times the ball would over roll and pot with unrealistic movement. All of these glitches makes me glad to never pay any amount of money. Dont pay a dime!",25-02-2022 23:18,sekou arafiles,1,237,,performance
,,,It would be such an amazing game if you could change the program that allows others to challenge you and show it while youre in the process of playing a game. Its not far to the players and the cross talks between players are there considering deleting the game because of this action. And the continuous glitches that stops the game or causes you to lose the gam or all youre money. Other than that i love this game. So can you please fix those issues.,24-02-2022 19:57,Lavern Bentley,4,336,,bug
,,,My husband and I really love playing this game and we both purchase the pool pass when they become available... however I will have to say it is ridiculous how this game lags... cant even aim because it keeps freezing up... then you get to win a few games but then lose like 10 in a row... and I dont think its right that you lose your earned trophies because you lose a game... I think this game needs better thinking and development... we have both come so very close to deleting this game,25-02-2022 17:34,MK MatZach,1,293,,positive
,,,"Hours of entertainment, but youll have to watch out for the players who are able to move balls on the table. Plus they are able to switch from solids to strips on you. And one more thing is the game will automatically go from you making every single shot to not winning a easy game. Its going to put on the difficult automatically if you win to many games in a row. Other than that I am a very avid fan of the game.",19-02-2022 15:46,WILL TIMMS,5,701,,positive
,,,"Super fun game! The guidelines have helped me on my shots so much not only online but in real life billiards as well. I wish there was an option where we could practice \trick\ shots or bank shots in the mini game section though; sort of a how to guide where you build your points by building your skills by practicing, since thats where I still have the most difficulty.",28-02-2022 13:08,Kasey Barbee,4,180,,positive
,,,Now that Ive worked up a ways the game acts like its trying to make sure I only win enough to keep me where I have to spend money to get any further. Other times Ill start a game and itll freeze up until my opponent is putting the I ball in th he pocket. Acts like someone has hacked it so they win all the time. Ive been trying to get my extra points for three days now and it still cant find one ad to play so I can pick up my extra points. Anyone else having this problem from 3/25-3/28,13-02-2022 19:58,Michael Q. Reed,3,111,,positive
,,,"very entertaining, enjoyable and I have met some awesome people from all over the world. Graphics are good, havent had many problems with the games and Ive been playing for a while now. Competition is very competitive and makes the games even more Interesting, you miss a shot and usually...game over. I enjoy the contests as well as the games, they are forever changing to keep it interesting at all levels! Well Played \)",16-02-2022 13:45,Deb Scarlett,5,177,,positive
,,,"LOVE the technological end it can do for actual billiards practice, besides running out of time on unconsistant cue times. 200k matches need tad more time.STOP ASKIN in app purchases OVER\u0026OVER. The actual advertising for unrelated apps, I understand. Please stop askin and/or insisting 3 or 4+ times in a row to make in app purchases on cues, coins, spins, surprise boxes, scratches, little green internet monopoly money. we know the offers are there so maybe just 2 or so DECENT. L‚ù§ve it overall.",19-03-2022 19:47,Keely Martinek,4,0,,positive
,,,"Im always recommending this game, its addictive and fun. Well it used to be. Call me paranoid but its funny how my opponents always has a shot, but myself Ill barley tap the cue ball yet it manages to travel across the table and drops, or lands just barley touching the opponents ball, or behind there balls causing me not having a shot. Ive gone up to 4 games not shooting a shot yet losing every game. Last night I counted 14 games before I was allowed to win. My theory is so that Ill buy more coins because I use to buy them a few times a day. So Ive completely stopped buying coins and find myself less and less interested in playing. Ill give you 3 stars when it used to be 5 plus, soon it might just be 1",22-02-2022 06:08,Daniel Perez,3,19,,positive
,,,"None of the rules in this game are based off of actual tournament level rules. It was obviously designed by idiots that didnt know how to play pool. In most games if you miss a ball the other player is allowed to move the cue ball, which can cause championships to be lost. As well as the fact that the game bugs out quite often and closes causing loss of any game that is being played. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND WASTING ANY AMOUNT OF TIME PLAYING!!!!",28-03-2022 20:19,Robert George,1,109,,bug
,,,!!BEWARE!! This game is HIGHLY ADDICTING \u0026 CHALLENGING!!! Which makes it Great for all fans of billiards no matter your age or skill level. üëç Connect and compete with friends to earn some bagging rights. Here are a few ideas that I think would make the it even better. *Providing more game PvP modes...* More interactive and animated avatars. ( like while theyre shooting shots). I think that would be an awesome upgrade. THANKS GREAT GAME,26-03-2021 12:11,Anthony anthonyisac1@yahoo.com,5,0,,positive
,,,"Great graphics but its basically app of ads that are trying to get your money; purchase something pop ups get on your screen every 3 seconds. Spin thing is just a joke, youll never get more than 150 points in it. If they dont want you to win, no matter how good you play, you will NOT win. And sometimes the opponent shoots the ball completely off direction and somehow they end up scoring. I guess they spend more money so they are the apps favorites.",25-03-2022 09:17,Gohar Y,1,251,,negative
,,,Great game to play pool! Really easy and simple to learn and I love the features! It only needs a section for your favorite or \Go-To\ pool sticks! Or maybe a box you can click to favorite that cue/pool stick and move them to the top of the list for quicker selection! Great idea Devs!! Edit: The Spin and Win is garbage!! You never get over 312 coins. Please fix from time to time.,22-04-2022 06:25,Jay,5,410,,positive
,,,First it has made me lose just by shutting down. It pops up your challenges and who to challenge in middle of game which messes with your shot. For example I accidently hit play now when it pooped while shooting lost a game I just started for substantial amount of chips.also no way to contact mods in app they make it very difficult so u just say screw it and go on. As a pool player motions are semi realistic.,17-04-2022 18:08,Jason Bergstrom,1,31,,negative
,,,"A lot of obligatory bs luck goes to the higher ranked players. I have seen way too many shots where someone is aiming way off from the pocket and it still goes in.. and I have also had shots that were aimed right at the center of a pocket and it misses. Fun to play as long as you dont put any money into it, and dont expect to hit high tiers.",08-03-2022 21:28,Stephen Randall,2,158,,bug
,,,"Really Minicilp? Just after 3am this morning game crashed, Again? Now I have to begin from scratch once again. Did all the things youve said to do in the past. Still wouldnt reload. I dont believe you all cant restore what players lose from your end. This is why I dont spend money with this game. Really wish youd fix your problems, 10 plus years and to many issues.",21-04-2022 18:58,Rusty Dean,1,354,,bug
,,,The is ok customer service is not. When you select a game lets say $ 1000000 by mistakenly touching the screen one time while trying to move the screen you loose the money their should be second step to confirm your game selection especially at this level. I lost 1 $1000000. Contacted them and the reply was cant give it back. They can surely see that I never play at that level. Very bad PR.,29-03-2022 05:47,Hans B,2,51,,negative
,,,"constant closing for no apparent reason in the middle of games and the time keeps running when you are starting back up so often times you lose your turn. Not to mention when you are starting the game back up it wastes time ok \updating.\ Constant nags to.. takes 2 minutes jumping through gimmicks to get to start a game. Do the developers actually test the games they create? Do they play them to find the faults? Too many sticks, practically forces you to keep upgrading sticks you will never use.",21-03-2022 22:08,Wes Greene,1,158,,performance
,,,Game is rigged. When you have a losing streak the computer is helping you win . When your winning the computer places your qball in spots that dont give you a shot. If this was not rigged it would be fun. Play for yourself and see that what Im saying is correct. Ive played for 2 years before realizing the pattern. I dont wanna play games that mess the outcomes.,03-04-2022 18:02,Discount Air Conditioning,1,106,,performance
,,,"Love playing this app especially when Im actually able to play it. For some reason the game just shuts down and closes after being clicked on, or at the beginning of the game after a match is chosen and my money is taken.

,,,"At first, I thought 8 ball pool was accurate and right on point. But, I noticed 3 different times while playing. The time ran faster than usual, and the stick staggered to move. Very upsetting when betting large on a game then all of a sudden something like that happens. 8 Ball Pool isnt like playing the real game but its fun when youre bored or betting small using your coins, do not give them your real money. By purchasing more coins or anything. Give it to charity if you just want to spend.",09-03-2022 16:14,The Yogi,1,240,,bug
,,,"Good game, but needs some fixes. Sometimes when lining up a shot, when you go to shoot, the angle will change, causing you to line up your shot again and that causes you to run out of time, giving the shot to yo the other person. Also sometimes the game will you close on you.... Both of those instances cause you to lose the coins you bet",25-01-2022 20:45,ralph clark sr,3,150,,bug
,,,"As a game, I enjoy it, but you have to deal with people using bots, and YES people use bots in this game. When they use them, the game is all glitchy, and the balls jump everywhere, and go places they cant possibly go. Plus you have really high level players, going against really low levels, with no possible way to beat them, because they run the table, before you even get a shot. I worked hard, to get 200,000 coins, just to be reduced to 1,000 coins, because of these two issues.",08-03-2022 11:57,Phyllis Murray,1,18,,positive
,,,"It does glitch at times, but Ill give it a pass because the quality is usually really good, and it doesnt happen often. However.. the bots annoy me. Its so obvious as to which players are bots as they have a super basic/common name (think Emma, Jacob, etc.) with proper grammar, they suck at playing, and their PFP is always an average person with a blurred background of nature or a house. That seems normal but its insanely obvious. I dont want to waste my time, but if I leave the match I lose",21-03-2022 05:16,jenny,3,152,,positive
,,,"Too many upper level hackers. Tournaments will freeze on the first game and they instantly become winners. Unlogical shots etc. Fun but after a few big games where no one ever misses a shot, it gets boring. Not to mention the bots.
